This project is a Vite-based web application that runs Python code in the browser using a WebAssembly Python runtime (e.g., Pyodide). It uses IndexedDB for persistent storage and simulates a Python execution container in WASM. Focus on integrating WASM Python, IndexedDB, and a modern UI for code editing and output display.
